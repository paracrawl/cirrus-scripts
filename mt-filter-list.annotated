## The following rules are based on popular translation plugins for web
## publishing platforms, in other words: Wordpress.
##

## Catches GTranslate plugin for Wordpress which does translation server-side
## (through a proxy server). Could also be detected by comment string at the end
## of document that translation server adds:
## "<!-- delivered by GTranslate v8.0.11 in 96ms visit https://gtranslate.io -->"
# div	id	gtranslate
# div	widget	GTranslate_widget2
# link	id	gtranslate-style-css
a	onclick	doGTranslate\('.{2}\|.{2}'\)

## Catches http://transposh.org/
# script	src	transposh.js
# script	src	http://tdn.gtranslate.net/tdn-bin/queue.js
# script	src	https://tdns3.gtranslate.net/tdn-bin/queue.js
# a	href	https://gtranslate.io

meta	name	translation-stats

## TranslatePress. First two patterns seem to be always there, but only when
## automatic translation is used the last (empty data-trp-gettext attributes on
## all text elements) starts to show up.
# body	class	translatepress
# script	src	trp-translate-dom-changes\.js
a	data-trp-gettext	$^

## Loco Translate doesn't seem to do automated full page translation, it only
## shows suggestions for translations inside Wordpress editor. There is however
## a plugin called "Automatic Translate Addon For Loco Translate" that makes this
## stupidly easy? Looking further into the code, the free option just adds a js
## Yandex widget. So nothing our crawler would have caught.

## polylang also doesn't seem to do automatic translation. So no need to filter it.
## There are other plugins for Polylang that do offer automatic translation through
## translation services like Lingotek.

## Weglot seems to be backed by a paid service that uses at least some form of
## manual labour to vet translations. However, it does offer automatic translations
## using DeepL.

## Google Website Translator by Prisna just embeds Google translate JS api.

## WP Translate – WordPress Translation Plugin by HahnCreativeGroup seems to be
## just JS again.

## Translate Your WP Website Hassle Free! by Ishai Jaffe offers "SEO support"
## which often means our crawler will pick it up. So let's see...
## Okay, service is called Babic, and the Wordpress plugin uses a proxy server.
## I haven't found a demo site that uses this (SEO support this way is not free.)

## Localize – Website Translation Integration (I have some... a lot of questions
## while reading this PHP code) It does add the language to the url, but
## translation seems to be handled by calling to the API from localizejs.com from
## JavaScript.

## Translate by Translate.com also just embeds Javascript.
