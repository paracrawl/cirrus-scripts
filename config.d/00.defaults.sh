# How many tasks should be run per subjob? See also SLRUM_TASKS_PER_NODE (or TPN)
# which works in tandem with TPB. E.g. TPN says each subjob runs 10 items from
# the batch list, and TPN says allocate enough resources to rnu 2 in parallel
# inside each subjob. (If SLURM feels like it there might be multiple subjobs on
# the same compute node though.)
# Or simpler: TPB exists to keep the length of job arrays down, but also keep each
# sub job within a time limit. TPN exists to make optimal use of exclusive nodes,
# but can also be used to add parallel execution into a subjob. But if TPN is 1,
# SLURM will take care of the parallelism.
